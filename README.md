# Kalken

This project was my first coding project in Java. It was done in 2009 in a project course during my second year at uni.
Although I had learned basic java in the course prior to this project course in a course called 'Obejct oriented
programming in Java' I did not seem to have grasped object oriented programming at this time. The main file Kalken is 
over 1000 lines long and full of repotions. The graphics turned out pretty good though. Might try to refactor this project
at a later time.
